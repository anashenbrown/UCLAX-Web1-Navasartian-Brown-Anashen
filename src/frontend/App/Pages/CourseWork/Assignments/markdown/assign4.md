### Assignment 4: What is the difference between a Front-End and Back-End Developer?

Front-End developer works on everything the user interacts with. The buttons, color, font, navigation, animation, and etc.

Back-End developer works on everything the user doesn't see. They work on the server, database, API creation, the web security and performance.
