### Assignment 1: Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language):**
HTML is the blueprint of the website. It tells the browser what elements exist. It provides structure and content.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**
CSS controls the appearance of the HTML. This includes font, color, size, animation and it can also include responsive design. This controls the appearance, not action.

**JavaScript:**
Javascript makes everything functional and interactive. This can include click action, opening and closing menus, and dynamic content changes.

In other words HTML is the skeleton/structure, CSS is the appearance, and Javascript is the functionality.
