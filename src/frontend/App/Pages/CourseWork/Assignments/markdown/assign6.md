### Assignment 6: What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and svg images?

All are image files are used for different purposes.

**JPEG** is a lossy image format, meaning it reduces file size by permanently removing some image detail.
Because of this compression, JPGs are great for photographs and complex, colorful images where a small loss of detail isn’t noticeable.
However, JPG does not support transparency and isn’t ideal for sharp graphics, text, or logos because they can appear blurry or pixelated.

**PNG** is a lossless image format, so it preserves all the original detail and quality.
It also supports transparency, which makes it perfect for UI elements, screenshots, logos, and graphics that need crisp edges or a clear background. PNG files are larger than JPGs, but the quality is much higher and more accurate.

**GIF** is a lossless format but limited to only 256 colors.
It's biggest strength is that it supports basic animation, allowing short, looping image sequences (like memes or reaction GIFs).
GIF also supports simple transparency but is not suitable for detailed images or photos because of its very limited color palette.

**SVG** is a vector image format, meaning it’s made from mathematical paths instead of pixels. This allows SVGs to scale to any size — from tiny icons to giant screens — without losing sharpness.
SVG is ideal for logos, icons, illustrations, and UI elements, and it can be styled or animated with CSS or JavaScript.
It is not suitable for photographs because photos are pixel-based, not vector-based.
