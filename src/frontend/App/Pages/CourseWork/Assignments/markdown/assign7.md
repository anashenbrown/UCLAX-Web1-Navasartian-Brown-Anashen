### Assignment 7: Define the following Agile roles: Product Manager, Scrum Master, UX Designer, Developer/Engineer, QA/SDET, and DevOps

**Product Manager:**
The Product Manager is responsible for what gets built and why.
They define the product vision, prioritize features in the backlog, gather requirements from stakeholders and users, and make trade-off decisions to maximize business and customer value.

**Scrum Master:**
The Scrum Master is the process coach for the team.
They help the team follow Agile/Scrum practices, remove blockers, facilitate standups, and protect the team from unnecessary interruptions so they can work effectively.

**UX Designer:**
The UX Designer focuses on how the product feels and works for users.
They research user needs, create wireframes and prototypes, design user flows, and collaborate with the team to ensure the product is usable, accessible, and intuitive.

**Developer/Engineer:**
Developers/Engineers are responsible for building the product.
They write, refactor, and maintain the code, collaborate on technical design, review each other’s work, and help turn user stories and designs into working, shippable software.

**QA/SDET:**
QA/SDET focuses on making sure the product works correctly and reliably. They design and run tests to find and report bugs, help define acceptance criteria, and work closely with developers to ensure quality is built into the product from the start.

**DevOps:**
DevOps engineers are responsible for how the software is delivered and run in production. They build and maintain CI/CD pipelines, manage infrastructure, monitor performance and reliability, and automate deployment and operations so the team can ship frequently and safely.
